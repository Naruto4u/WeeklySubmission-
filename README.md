This week, I have mostly focused on codewars and the assignments given.. However towards the end of the day I realized that it turns out, there is a lot more information on Skill Struck that I should probably be learning, so I'm working on the rest of Python 2.

I am making process towards getting certified, but it will still take me quite some time because I still have trouble understanding most of what I am doing.
