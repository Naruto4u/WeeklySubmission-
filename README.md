Still going to be putting effort into this, but I am still just starting out, the most confusing part was how I was supposed to put in code that would then be returned to the question stuff, but I eventually got the hang of it. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6469432c-93cd-49d3-aa76-254417c38b7f)
Did some other stuff, not too much though.
